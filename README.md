#Neighborhood Map Project

### Introduction
This project is a single page application of the breweries in where I live, in Maryland.
I combined my interest (trying new craft beers) and to introduce them to others.
I used React, Google Map API and other third party API like [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) for an offline accessible app.
